# QUERY-SUGGESTION-PIPILIKA


Query Suggestion is a search engine feature whereby the system suggests completed queries as
the user types a starting text. Such queries are typically selected among previously stored queries,
based on specific attributes. However, queries cannot be suggested if a users text does not match
any queries in the storage. In order to suggest queries for previously unseen text, we propose
a neural language model which is called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that learns how to
generate a query from a starting text and and we evaluate the proposed methods with a public
data set. Our applied approach has no dependency on query log and this method has lower time
complexity.
